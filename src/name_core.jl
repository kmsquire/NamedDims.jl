# This is the core functionality for manipulating dimension names expressed as a tuple.
# It is central to the performance of named dimensions as a zero cost abstraction.
# For constant input, all functions should constant propagate to constant output.
# Each function in this file is annotated with a comment and a benchmark;
# running that benchmark should return 0 allocations,
# and you can swap its `@btime` for `@code_typed` to check if it is constant propagating.
# This constant propagation lets us write faily naive code elsewhere in the package,
# knowing that the creation and destruction of NamedDimsArrays will be optimised away.

"""
    compile_time_return_hack(x)

This is a cunning hack to strongly encourage the compiler to use constant propagation,
when returning a `Tuple` of `Symbols`.
Under normal circumstances, constant propagation will not work to fully compute
returned tuples of non-bits types.
But because `Symbol`s are a allowed in type-parameters (unlike other nonbits types),
we can put them into a type-parameter, which triggers (??different??) constant propagation,
(for ??Reasons??)
and once something is a type-parameter, then extracting it and returning it is non-allocating.

See https://discourse.julialang.org/t/zero-allocation-tuple-subsetting/23122/8

The short version of this is:
if a function returns a tuple of symbols and is allocating when it looks like it shouldn't be,
then try wrapping its returned value in `compile_time_return_hack`.
and then look at the `@code_lowered` again.

    dim(dimnames, [name])

`dimnames` is a tuple of names (symbols) for the dimensions.
If `dim` is called with just this tuple, it
returns a named tuple, with each name mapped to a dimension,

If the second `name` argument is given, then the dimension corresponding to that `name`
is returned, e.g. `dim((:a, :b), :b) == 2`.
